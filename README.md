# PyBank and PyPoll

This two-part project encompasses two real-world situations, each requiring Python scripting skills. Both parts print a final analysis to the terminal and export a text file with results.

## PyBank
This challenge analyzes the financial records of a company's monthly profits and losses.

### Data Source:
[budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv)


## PyPoll

This challenge seeks to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. Using Python and raw voting data, a winning candidate is determined.   

### Data Source:
[election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv)

### Prerequisites (for both projects):
* python 3.6.7
